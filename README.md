## âš™ 2. Installation Steps (After Downloading ZIP)

### Step 1 â€” Extract Project
1. Download the ZIP file
2. Extract it to a folder, e.g., `seng8071-final`

```bash
cd seng8071-final
````

---

### Step 2 â€” Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### Step 3 â€” Create `.env` File

In the project root, create a `.env` file with your database connection info:

```env
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=Project
```

---

### Step 4 â€” Start PostgreSQL in Docker

If you donâ€™t already have Postgres running:

```bash
docker run --name postgres-seng8071 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

---

### Step 5 â€” Create the Database & Load Data

1. Open pgAdmin
2. Create a database named **`Project`**
3. Run the `midterm.sql` script from the project to create tables and insert sample data

---

### Step 6 â€” Run the API

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API should start on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Check with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

You should see:

```
SENG8071 API running
```
